<h2>Some thoughts for new developers</h2>

<h3>The value of pushing on</h3>
<p>A lot of people that are starting out in the tech space often get a bit overwhelmed with the amount of information that is out there. This personally happened to me as well when I was starting out my professional programming career. I say professional but this also applies if you just program as a hobby, which is ultimately how I started... There is an abundance of information online, something I tell students that I mentor is that you should really aim to only focus on one thing at a time. Get really good at something and only then learn more things. Don't start off trying to learn how to master all these frameworks and languages. Frameworks change, languages don't really. That would have helped me when I was getting started. The frameworks are not really that important. It is a lot more important to know the languages properly then move onto learning the frameworks. Of course, you can do this, but it will hold you back because in the long term you will get stuck. Once you know one langauge well learning another is a lot easier. And the frameworks become a lot easier to pick up as well when you already kknow what you are doing. So start with that... Also, if you are interested in getting into web development such as myself, learn javascript and python. Those languages are easy to pick up and make sense of. If you are not forced to I really wouldn't recommend getting started with a language like C#, Java or C++. I find that a lot of the time it can be demotivating to first timers. The reason for this is the complexity of the languages in comparison. Learning C# and the ASP.NET framework is not easy when getting started. I say this with C# being my goto for most things. It is a very powerful langauge, but not easy to just pick up if you know nothing about code (although it would be better if you have a good mentor). It's easy to say it's easy when you already know it.</p>
